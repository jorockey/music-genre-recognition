# Music Genre Recognition

The goal of this project is to look at audio from popular music and using neural networks classify the music into genres. The genres being investigated are 
blues, classical, country, disco, hip-hop, jazz, metal, pop, reggae, and rock. The dataset being used is the GTZAN database which contains 100 music samples
for each of the 10 genres (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andradaolteanu/gtzan-dataset-music-genre-classification). Each sample is 30 seconds long. This classification
will be done using a visual representation of the audio, called a Mel Spectrogram. The neural network will perform image classification on these visual representations.

The project was created in a .ipynb file in Google Colab. To run in the Jupyter environment, some code relating to file input would need slight changes.
